/// You can implement a PhoneBook that can hold
/// up to 10 name-phoneNumber pairs
///
/// Operations to support:
/// - Count: Retrieves how many numbers are stored
/// - Add(string name, string phoneNumber)
///     Adds the specified name-phoneNumber pair to the phonebook.
/// - Remove(string name): removes the pair which name is "name"
/// - Print(): 
///     Displays in the console all the name-number pairs 
///     stored in the phone book. One pair per line.
///
/// Notice that the specification is very "open". You can
/// decide how to handle the edge cases. For example,
/// what happens when the phonebook is full and you try to
/// add another pair. What happens when you try to add a pair
/// that which name already exists. What happens when you
/// try to delete a pair which name does not exist and so on.
///
/// There is no "correct" answer. It is all up to you to decide
/// how YOUR phonebook will work :)
///
/// Have Fun!
